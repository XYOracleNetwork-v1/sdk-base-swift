## Getting Started 

### Swift Package Manager

```swift
  .package(url: "https://github.com/XYOracleNetwork/sdk-base-swift.git", from: "1.0.4")
```

### Carthage

- If you do not have Carthage, install
```sh
  brew install carthage
```
- Check for the most recent version if necessary
```sh
  carthage version
```
- Create a Cartfile in the root directory of your project
```sh
  touch Cartfile
```

- In your Cartfile, add `sdk-base-swift` as a dependency
```sh
  github "https://github.com/XYOracleNetwork/sdk-base-swift"
```

- Clone the `sdk-base-swift` dependency and build it into a framework
```sh
  carthage update
```

You should now see an update to your project structure with these inclusions
```sh
- your-root-project
  - Carthage
    - Checkouts
  - Cartfile.resolved
```

- Now open xcode 

- Open the newly created Carthage directory 
```sh
  open Carthage
```

- Go to the `Carthage/Build/` directory
- Then open the `iOS` folder
- Grab both `XyBaseSdk` frameworks and drag them into xcode


### Requirements
- iOS 11.0+
- Xcode 10.1+
- Swift 4.2+
